Here is a data analysis project of a store called Tripti Stores using excel based on their sales data of 2022. Here I have done - 
Data Cleaning
I have taken raw data and cleaned it so that the data can be analyzed. I have made sure that there is no null data or invalid data type.
Data Processing and Analyzing
I have processed the cleaned data and analyzed it so that it becomes easy to understand.
Creating Interactive Dashboard
I have created an interactive dashboard so that can be operated easily to get the insights of various business questions such as - 
Highest selling month
Target age group
Target area
Most profitable sales channel and etc..
